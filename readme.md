# Final Year Project - 2330

## Meeting 1

1. discussed the topics we can do for final year project
2. analysed various possibilities of research.

## Result 1

1. Decided to go with project on software defined networking. with possibility of having AI for better performance

## Meeting 2

### Found the following topics are researchable in SDN

1. intrusion detection system
2. defense against DOS attack
3. energy conservation in SDN
4. efficient networking in AI
5. Automatic alert manager

## Result 2

1. analysed the advantages, feasibility of each of the ideas.
2. selected "IDS detection and defense using Software defined network with alert manager" as the tentative topic.

## Meeting 3

### Literature review

Gone through various research papers available online with regard to the FYP project.

1. learnt various research already done using ML
2. found the IDS dataset names
3. Saw various tools like mininet, NS3 etc. for simulation.
4. Analysed online projects available with ML on IDS (github).

## Result 3

1. Analyse the IDS dataset with malicious packets.
2. Find various patterns without ML used for IDS.
3. contact suricata for help in project.
4. selected mininet as the software for simulation.

## Meeting 4

### So far

1. installed mininet
2. reading suricata docs
3. understanding more about SDN
4. learning python API for mininet to create simulation.

### Next steps
